## FAQs

1. Why we created this repo? :question:
    - We, the main contributors (@HimanshuSinghGH and @krshrimali) to BuffetCodes believe in learning daily. This repository will help us share our progress, implementations and more. :v:
2. Is this open to contributions? :question:
    - For now, we are open sourcing it only for others to see what we are upto, what we know and what might be worth learning. We might be open to contributions later on, but for now - this is going to be heavily populated by us. Stay tuned. :watch:
3. What else is in the store? :question:
    - Oh, a lot. We are staying home (as of 11th April 2020) for quite a days now. This also means, that we want to make good use of it, together (:handshaking:), so you'll see a lot of things coming your way. :fireworks:
